# what3numbers
[z, x, y] as a space partitioning code

## Background
I want to give a catchy name for the [slippy map tilenames](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames) tile number.

## Specifications
A what3numbers is the tile number in slippy map tilenames concatenated by hyphens('-') in the [z, x, y] order, e.g., 2-3-1.

## Actual applications
- what3numbers is in [module-spec](https://github.com/hfu/module-spec). The module-spec is used in producing vector tile datasets.

## Site
To be developed at https://hfu.github.io/what3numbers

## See also
- [what2numbers](https://what2numbers.org) is a great way to identify an exact location, rather than a partition of space.
